<h2>Partial Constant Propagation Support Redesign</h2>

<p>
<i>Note that where necessary to avoid name clashes with existing working
code, redesigned method and class names have been prefixed with an underscore.</i>

<h3>Values and Bits</h3>

As before, a {@link _Bit Bit} represents a single bit value in the LIM graph.  Its
design has been simplified resulting in the removal of the package private
BasicBit class.  Otherwise a Bit has most of the same methods, and its meaning
is straightforward.  There are four global bits, {@link _Bit#ZERO ZERO},
{@link _Bit#ONE ONE}, {@link _Bit#CARE CARE}, and {@link _Bit#DONT_CARE DONT_CARE},
which can be used in any context.  All other bits are created as components of
a {@link Bus}.
<P>
A {@link _Value Value} is an ordered list of any Bits.  It is created with
a set width, which never changes.  Only the identities of the individual Bits
may be changed using {@link _Value#setBit(int,_Bit)}.

<h3>Ports and Buses</h3>

Each {@link Port} and {@link Bus} has a {@link _Value Value} reference.  This
reference is initially null.  The value is created when the method
{@link Port#setSize(int,boolean)} or {@link Bus#_setSize(int,boolean)} is
called.  The Value may only be created once.  From that point, it may only be
modified by setting its individual Bits.  In particular, this means that
the size of a Value will always be the native size of the data that it
represents.  Data path narrowing will be indicated by the presence of
constants and don't-care bits in the value.
<p>
The forward propagation of Values into a Port is supported by the
method {@link Port#_pushValueForward()}.  This method updates the
Port's Value based upon the Value of its connected Bus (or dependent
Bus's, if prior to scheduling).  In addition, if an initial Value has
not yet been created for the Port, one will be constructed using the
attributes of the incoming Value.
<p>
The backward propagation of a Value into a Port (that is, from the inside
of a {@link Component} to the outside) is supported with the
{@link Port#_pushValueBackward(_Value)} method.  In this case the
Value that updates the Port is provided by the component.
<p>
Similarly, the forward propagation of a Value into a {@link Bus} is
supported by the {@link Bus#_pushValueForward(_Value)} method.  Again
the update Value is provided by the component.  And if the Bus's Value
does not yet exist, it will be created by this method via a call
to {@link Bus#_setSize(int,boolean)}.
<p>
The backward propagation of Values into a {@link Bus} is supported
by the method {@link Bus#_pushValueBackward()}.  This method looks at
the Ports connected to the Bus (or dependent on the Bus, if prior to
scheduling) to obtain a composit Value for updating.
<p>
In general, only don't-care values are propagated backwards, while
only cares, constants, and bus bits are propagated forwards.

<h3>Components</h3>

The support for constant propagation at the Component level has not
changed.  It will still be implemented in the methods
{@link Component#forwardPropagate()} and {@link Component#reversePropagate()}.
These methods will have to be reimplemented for all Component types to
use the new methods in Port and Bus.
<p>
The higher level constant propagation algorithms should not require
modification.

<h3>Representation</h3>

The data model for this new representation is shown here:
<p>
<img src="doc-files/Value.png">
<p>
Each Bus has its own unique list of component Bits, as well as
an immutable Value reference (once created, it never changes).
The Bits contained in this Value and any Value are completely
arbitrary, and may be modified with a call to {@link _Value#setBit(int,_Bit)}.
Each Port also has its own Value, which again is immutable after
it is created.  These Values should only be modified by calls to
the various <i>push-</i> methods.

<h3>Open Issues</h3>

Analysis must be performed to determine whether any changes must be
made to reconcile this new representation with the specification
expected by the Verilog translator package.

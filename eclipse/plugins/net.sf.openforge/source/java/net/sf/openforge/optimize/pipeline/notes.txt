- each component has 3 gate depths:
  - maxEntry -- max from an entry point in
  - maxExit -- max leaving a compoenent
  - maxGateDepth -- longest unbreakable path in component

- maxComponentGateDepth is the largest of the three for all components in the graph; this
becomes the max unbreakable gate depth for the design

- getMaxInputGateDepth is pretty simple -- just the max gate depth

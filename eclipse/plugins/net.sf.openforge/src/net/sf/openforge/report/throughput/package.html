<p>The throughput package contains classes related to reporting on the
throughput of the design.
<h2>Throughput Analyzer</h2>
<p>Throughput analysis is the process of determining how often new data
can be applied to a given design.  There are 3 criteria which factor into
this determination:
<ol>
<li>Whether the design has been balanced during scheduling.
<li>Loops in the design (explicit feedback)
<li>Multiple accesses to any 'global' resource (implicit feedback)
</ol>
<p>If the design contains no feedback (explicit or implicit) and was
balanced during scheduling, then it may accept new data every clock
cycle.  If the design was not balanced, then data may be applied only
after the previous done.  Any type of feedback mandates a pause in the
assertion of new data until that feedback has been completely resolved.
For loops this means the loop has completed iterating.  For implicit
feedback, this is the number of clock cycles between the first and
last access(es) to the resource.
<p>The spacing of input data will fall into one of these categories:
<ul>
<li>Indeterminate.  Data may be applied only after the previous done
has been received.
<li>Fixed.  Data may be applied exactly every 'n' cycles.
<li>Bounded.  Data may be applied at least every 'n' cycles, but based on
knowledge of the design you may be able to apply it more often (criteria
comes from bounded loops which may terminate earlier than max bound)
</ul>
<p>Development tasks
<ul>
<li>Characterize Loops.  Push knowledge of loop bounds out of
LoopUnrollingVisitor and into Loop.
<li>Add capacity to ScheduleVisitor to determine latency difference
between multiple accesses to same resource.  All pins share a same
'virtual' resource.
<li>Add mechanism to report top 'n' critical paths that reduce throughput.
<li>Annotate each task with minimum data/go spacing.
</ul>

<h1>lim.memory package</h1>
<p>Last modified: $Date: 2005-12-01 10:19:34 -0800 (Thu, 01 Dec 2005) $
<p>This package is intended to group together all classes and functionality
related to memory/array/object support in the LIM.

<h2>Support for &lt;Array&gt;.Length operations</h2>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Allow usage of &lt;array&gt;.length syntax in source
<li>Allow dynamic usage of .length.  i.e. the access to .length
does not need to be to a compile time determinate target.
<li>Compile time determinate accesses to .length should resolve
to constant values in LIM and as such can be used as loop bounds, etc.
<li>Minimize overhead added to lim and/or array accesses in support of
.length.
</ul>
<h3>Design:</h3>
<p>The &lt;array&gt;.length operator is supported by adding an
additional 'field' to each array allocated in the users design.  This field
is located at offset 0 of the array when instantiated in memory and contains
a constant primitive value that identifies the allocated length of the array.
Array accesses add 1 to the index to access the correct element of the array.
If all accesses to the &lt;array&gt;.length field have been removed (or there
are no accesses) then the field is removed and the addition of 1 to the index
to form a memory offset is removed.

<h2>Memory types and characteristics</h2>
<p>In the Virtex2&reg; FPGA family there are 2 types of memory resources
available to the designer.  These are Block RAM (BRAM) and LUT RAM (aka
distributed RAM).
<p>The BRAM are allocated in 18Kb blocks, organized as 18Kb
(2<sup><font size=-2>14</font></sup>) by 1 bit.  The number of available BRAM
is dependant on the specific part selected.  Each BRAM has 2 fully independent
ports, thus there is no penalty for using a 2nd port on a BRAM.  Each BRAM
<i>cannot</i> be divided into 2 independent memories.  Both the read and
write accesses to a BRAM take 1 clock cycle.  Read accesses register the
read address before driving the accessed data on the outputs.
<p>The LUT RAM are implemented in the LUT's of each CLB.  Each LUT can be
configured as a 16 element 1-bit wide (16x1) memory with a single access port.
2 LUT's can be combined to create a dual port memory where 1 port is read/write
and the other is a read-only port (memory shadowing technique).  Multiple
LUT's can be stacked to created a memory up to 128 elements deep.  Write accesses
to LUT RAM are synchronous and read accesses are fully combinational from
address port to data out (0 cycles).

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Each LIM Memory component is annotated with 2 pieces of information that
determine how it is scheduled and how it gets translated.  These are:
<ul>
<li>Implementation in LUT vs BRAM
<li>is ROM
</ul>
<p>Based on these two criteria the criteria for scheduling (latency) can be
determined.  The user has control over both of these criteria allowing them
to specify the exact final implementation.  The LUT vs BRAM is a user
preference while the ROM is based on their usage in the source code.
<p>Since a dual port LUT ROM is 2X the size of a single Port and we replicate
ROMS based on the number of accesses, there is no extra overhead to allocate
dual ports to ANY type of ROM.  Thus all ROMS should allocate dual ports
before replicating.
<p>Currently we do not allow for dual port RAM's.  When this support is added
we must be sure that if the implementation is LUT RAM that one port is marked
as being a read-only port.
<p><i><font color=FF4444>TBD FEATURE: </font></i>An API or preference tagging
feature needs to be added to allow individualized control over different
memories in the design so that 2 memories of equal size can be allocated
to LUT or BRAM independently.  EG the user may want a 16x8 ROM in LUTs and a
16x8 RAM in BRAM since it is written to by 2 different sources.
<p>Tasks to implement combinational ROMS (please delete when accomplished):
<ul type=square>
<li>Add isLUT and isBRAM methods to Memory.  These need to make use of the
information available in the mapper to determine what the implementation will
be based on the size of the memory and the available technologies.
<ul>
<li>Since the Memory size may change during optimizations the lookup needs to
be performed each time the method is called (or cached up based on the size,
and re-looked up each time the size changes, perhaps at the end of the
'buildMemory' method).
<li>This means that the functionality in the memory mapper should be split into
2 parts.  The first part only determines what type of memory the Memory should
be implemented in.  The second part determines how to implement it (finding
the correct primitive and doing the translation).  The first part is called by
the Memory whenever it's size changes and sets the fields for lut/bram.  Then
this annotated information is used by the 2nd part so that everything is working
from the same sets of information.
</ul>
<li>Update the getLatency() method in MemoryPort such that it correctly
reflects the particular implementation of the backing memory.  The latency for
LUT RAMS differs based on the type of access (read vs write) so the latency
reported for MemoryRead will differ from that of MemoryWrite based on the
implementation.  To keep this information centrally located MemoryPort and/or
Memory should implement a getLatency (MemoryAccess access) where the access can
report if it is read or write and the method will return the appropriate
Latency.
<li>Update the translation engine to support the block and LUT ram correctly.
LUT RAM should always be combinational and the Block RAM always sequential (registered).
The LUT RAM implementation should <b>not</b> register the data output.  The
DONE for the LUT memory implementation should be:<pre><kbd>
          assign DONE = RE | we_reg;
          FD reg_xxx(.D(WE), .Q(we_reg), .C(CLK));
</kbd></pre>
</ul>
<p>Other memory implementation tasks:
<ul type=square>
<li>Update the gatedepth for any MemoryAccess to query the backing memory for
entry and exit gatedepth.  Gatedepth of the memory is as follows, note that
somewhere the depth associated with the gateways and referee's should be taken
into account.
<table align=center border=1>
<tr align=center><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Entry Depth</th><th>Gate Depth</th><th>Exit Depth</th></tr>
<tr align=center><td>Block RAM/ROM read</td><td>0</td><td>?</td><td>0(?latched)</td></tr>
<tr align=center><td>Block RAM write</td><td>0</td><td>?</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr align=center><td>LUT RAM/ROM read</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr align=center><td>LUT RAM write</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>
<li>Removed the distracting, non-used, getAccessLatency method in MemoryAccess.
</ul>

<h2>'Unit' lane addressable memory</h2>
In order to be compatible with C style memory accesses, as well as arbitrary
bit width memory implementations, the backing memory implementation must allow
for any given location to be accessed as any multiple of the addressing stride.
The addressing stride is defined as the number of bits that make up one addressable
location in the memory.  
To further complicate the access characteristics, the 'base' of
each access is not guaranteed to fall on any fixed boundry.  For example, in a
C style, byta addressable memory, and given an integer (32 bit) with value
0xabcdef10 in memory, the value may be accessed in the following ways:
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Offset</th><th>Access size</th><th>Returned Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>8-bit</td><td>0x10</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>8-bit</td><td>0xef</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>8-bit</td><td>0xcd</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>8-bit</td><td>0xab</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>16-bit</td><td>0xef10</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>16-bit</td><td>0xabcd</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>32-bit</td><td>0xabcdef10</td></tr>
</table>
This dictates that each addressable unit of the memory must be individually
addressable and modifiable.  However, the overhead involved in retrieving
or modifying standard word sizes (eg 2, 4, or 8 addressable units at a time)
is unacceptable.
<p>This leads us to develop a memory structure which can be accessed in 
multiples of the addressable unit in a single cycle.  Specifically, the
allowable multiples are 1, 2, 4, or 8 units.  Additionally, the structure
must accept an offset into the accessed location at which to 'base' the
access.  The structure described here meets all those criteria and introduces
a minimum of overhead (additional logic) to manage the data and enables.
<p>First, lets define the signals that the memory will be supplied and produce.
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Signal</th><th>direction</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>Din</td><td>input</td><td>Data input (write data)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Addr</td><td>input</td><td>Address, in addressable units</td></tr>
<tr><td>En</td><td>input</td><td>read enable</td></tr>
<tr><td>We</td><td>input</td><td>write enable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Size</td><td>input</td><td>access size (encoded)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dout</td><td>output</td><td>Data output (read data)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The address signal is 'unit aligned', meaning that each incremental value
represents one stride through memory.  This means that if a memory is 4
addressable units wide, then each physical 'line' of memory will be
accessed by every 4th address value (eg 0, 4, 8, ...).  The address will be
managed according to the structure of the memory such that some of the LSB
bits may (or may not) be used to define the offset into a given line of memory.
<p>The size signal is an encoded value which defines the width of the read
or write access.  The 2-bit encoding is as follows:
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Number of Addressable Units Accessed</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The structure of the memory is to be built up of 'n' banks of individual
memory elements in order to be independently accessible without modifying other
elements in the same memory line.  The number of banks is determined by the
width of the memory divided by the width of each bank.  Thus a 32 bit memory
with 8 bit banks would require 4 memory banks.  Similarly a 26 bit memory with
13 bit banks would require 2 memory banks.
<p>Once each bank has been instantiated we must instantiate logic to generate
enables to each bank and logic to ensure that the data is correctly aligned to
each bank for writes and that read data is correctly aligned to the data bus
for presentation to the accessor.
<h3>Select Generation</h3>
<p>Each memory bank requires an individualized enable signal that is used to
qualify the read and/or write enable to the memory as a whole to determine
whether the specific bank is being accessed.  This enable is based on a
combination of the size and lsb bits of the address according to the following
schematic:
<br><img align="top" src="doc-files/ByteSel.png">
<p>Given the example of a 32 bit memory with 8-bit banks (ie 4 banks) the
constants are:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>C0</td><td>0x0F</td></tr>
<tr><td>C1</td><td>0x01</td></tr>
<tr><td>C2</td><td>0x03</td></tr>
<tr><td>C3</td><td>0xFF</td></tr>
</table>
This encoded select value is then shifted by the LSB bits of the address to
generate the memory bank enables.  The logic contained in the 'Bank Logic'
section is simply a constant magnitude shift to generate a 1-bit enable signal
(selection of the correct bit from the encoded select) which is then logically
and'ed with the read and write enables for the memory.  Thus, only the 8-bit
wide 4:1 mux (common to all banks), the left shift (common to all banks), and
2 and gates (per memory bank) are functional logic.
<h3>Data Movement</h3>
<p>In order to ensure correct data alignment, the incoming and outgoing data
must be shifted left and right respectively by a given number of bits based
on the address being accessed.  The magnitude of this shift is taken directly
from the least significant bits of the address bus and is based on the number
of banks in the widest memory and the number of bits per addressable location.
<p>The addressing scheme of all memories is addressable unit aligned, meaning
that the number of address bits used to shift incoming/outgoing data will vary
based on the width of the memory.  For example, in a 32 bit memory with 8 bit
address stride only the lsb 2 bits of the address are used in shifting.  However
in a 64 bit memory with 8 bit address stride, the lsb 3 bits of the address will
be used.  The number of address bits used for aligning incoming/outgoing data
in a given memory is 
<code>log<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>(memory width/address stride)</code>
<p>The data handling is detailed by this logic:
<br><img align="top" src="doc-files/StructuralDataFlow.png">
<p>The incoming data is shifted by the required number of <b>addressable units</b> as
specified by the lsb bits of the address.  In our 32-bit/8-bit-bank memory,
the address 0x0 is already aligned with the data bus (the lsb 2 bits of the
address are 0, thus we shift by 0 bits).  However, the address 0x1 indicates
the 2nd location in memory.  Incoming data will be LSB aligned, thus our SHL needs
to move the data to the 2nd byte lane for a correctly aligned write.  So, we
will shift it by 1 * 8 bits.  A corallary process happens during reads by
shifting the data back to the right.
<p><b>Note:Since the accessing instruction knows the number of addressalbe
locations it is reading, we rely on that instruction to ignore any MSB bits
 that are not desired.</b>
<p>Additionally, each bank has logic to mask the data coming out of the bank
and feeding that into a common 'or'.  This logic is all pass-through logic
that is used to assemble (concatenate) the banks it a single bus before feeding
it to the right shift operation.

<p>The data for a 64 bit memory with byte addressing is included here for
validation of this logic.

<p>This package groups together the classes and functionality responsible
for replacing standard LIM operations with user defined functionality from
source code libraries.

<h2>Operations supported in replacement</h2>
<p>The actual correlation between which operations are supported, and the
method name to be implemented by a library for implementing that operation
is maintained in the ReplacmentCorrelation class.

<h2>Overview of replacement</h2>
<p>The operation replacement code allows the user to write methods in a library
that will be used to implement given operations in the LIM.  These methods
must contain only forgeable code, as they are converted into LIM
implementations by compiling (but not optimizing) the library class.
Replacement is accomplished by creating a call to the uniquified (cloned)
procedure and connecting the ports and buses of that call according to the
connections of the operation being replaced.

<h2>Replacments from libraries with fields</h2>
<p>Operation replacement supports library implementations that contain object
and static fields.  These resources (and any other accessed resources in the
<b>libraries</b> design) are merged into the user's design when the first
operation is replaced.  If the replacement method is non static, then
each time an operation is replaced with that method, an entirely new tree of 
fields is created by essentially cloning the root object of the users design.
This new tree of logic is set as the target of the method by creation of a
'deferred constant' whose value is the base address of that new tree in the
design memory.  This has the effect of creating a new instance of the library
class for each operation that is replaced.
<p>IPCore objects in the library require a bit of special handling because
Forge uses the user created IPCore object in building the IPCore instantiation.
For this reason, the IPCore object itself must also be copied as well as any
pins that are used by that IPCore object.
<p>The end result of libraries that make use of fields is that any static field
in the library represents a shared resource.  All replaced operations (that use
an implementation from that library) will share the logic/hardware allocated by
that static field.  Non static fields (object fields) represent unique hardware
and any replaced operations using an implementation from that library will have
a completely unique copy of that logic/hardware to operate on.  Consequently,
an IPCore that is stored in a static field will only be allocated 1 instance
that is shared by all replaced operations.  Whereas an IPCore allocated in a
non static field will have one instance allocated for each replaced operation.
